# Brian Goldman

Founder–builder working at the intersection of software infrastructure, payments-adjacent systems, and skill-based competitive gaming platforms.

I design and build systems that automate complex workflows end-to-end, from user onboarding and verification through transaction handling, contest orchestration, and settlement logic, with an emphasis on clarity, compliance-awareness, and scale.

Focus areas:
